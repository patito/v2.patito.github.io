            <p>Are you thinking that I had arrived in London and started working straight away in computer science? Well, I got lucky, I began as a Busser, WTF?</p>

<p><strong>Busser is a person that does everything the waiters don’t wanna do.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Translating:</strong> it is the waiter’s assistant, means that you have to do the bad part of the job, for example, cleaning the tables, the floor, the toilets, helping the waiter, not tips, though. And the worst part of it: doing the cutlery.</p>

<p>I began working in a famous american restaurant on the Haymarket Street, close to the Trafalgar Square. The restaurant is popular for keeping things (objects) used in Hollywood films and for it’s hamburger.</p>

<p>My very first day at the job was a bit stressful, as a result of my anxiety, just like any beginner. Yet, I believe that no beginner can make so many mistakes on his first day at work and not being fired. Before I’ve even started working properly I’ve made a waitress drop all the mustard jars on the stairs, that happen because she was desiring my body! Just kidding, I pump on her while she was going downstairs. All I can remember was my boss wagging his head in disapprovement. I think that in that moment he was telling to himself: why would I hire a hobbit? He badly knew I was about to do more shits.</p>

<p>In the exact same day, I was cleaning some tables and my manager, that I could felt did not liked me, pushed me to do a lot of things at the same time, so I wanted to tell him that I was not multi-thread, but words came out wrong and instead i said: “I’m alone”. Why God I did such a thing? He immediately said that I should stop cleaning and meet him in a private office, he kept saying: “I’m your boss. Do you know that?” I can make fun of it now, but in that moment, I was thinking: fuck, fuck, fuck. He spoke for about 30 minutes. I was sure that I would be fired, but some sort of elvish intervetion, I was not.</p>

<p>Now you are thinking, how can someone make so many shits on his first day at work? Hey, easy there, never doubt of the capacity of Titão hobbit. Same evening, the restaurant was super busy, when I was going towards the toilets, to clean them, I spilled sanitizer on a custumer. After a long talk and many apologies, I told her that the product would not stain her clothes, I didn’t even know what I was talking about, but in the end she accepted my apologies.</p>

<p>As the days went by my easeness started to drop, I improved my English, I got used with the restaurant and the tasks, and even I started making jokes with my colleagues. Yet, one think I couldn’t avoid doing was mistakes. On one very busy night, the music was loud and there were drunk people dancing, I saw a customer wagging and calling me. That said, bussers are not supposed to deal with the customer, that’s a waiter’s task. Anyway, I went to see what she wanted and politely I asked her what was wrong. But couldn’t understand what she was saying, I could just notice her pointing to her dish, and naively took it and throw it away. hahahha! Who in my situation would not do that? However, What she was trying to make me undestand is that she wanted to take the food away. Upsy-daisy! They had to make a new dish for her and I had to deal with the managers explaining to me what “to take away” means. A certain day I woke up from a nightmare screaming “Take awayyyy”.</p>

<p>One of my tasks was to keep the toilets clean and tidy, and never leave them without toilet paper, every 30 minutes we had to check them, to see if everything was ok. The male toilet was always fine, but for the female one I can’t say the same. How can women clog everything? The sink, toilet, rubbish, everything was a chaos. When you are in a restaurant and your girlfriend goes to the toilet, and then she comes back all smiley and even send you a kiss on her way back to the table. You don’t know, but she has just clog three toilets, two sinks and has smoked a cigarette while she has been making number two. This was the exact impression the female toilet left on me.</p>

<p>The female toilet really had an impact on me. There were this time I was going to clean the toilet, I had openned the door and said: “I’m coming in”, to let the girls know. When you clean a toilet you are supposed to look in each cabin, to make sure that there is toilet paper available.</p>

<p>The women toilets really struck me. Once I went to clean it, opened the door and said: “I’m coming”. This is a good practice to warn the girls that a boy is intering. When we clean the toilets we have to verify all toilets has papers, for that we have to visit all toilets. In one these visits I had a little surprise, one girl was pupping with the door open, so, she didn’t close the door. When I opened it, the crazy girl was in her moment, I stopped and thought: I’m fucked. When she saw me, started screaming. I didn’t know what to do, maybe hide or say sorry. How can I say sorry to a girl pupping? Tricking isn’t it? I think she will never use a toilet in a restaurant again, but if she does, at least she will remember to lock the door.</p>

<p>Other important task of bussers is to do the cutlery, and most of them hate this, because it’s under pressure, and after a time your arms are tired and aching. The task was a common reason for discussions in my team.</p>

<p>Every time we clean the tables, we had to take the glasses and dishes to be washed in the kitchen. The kitchen of a restaurant is a busy place and very funny. The guys who used to do the dishes were Colombian and spoke a horrible English. I used to talk to them in Spanish. Several times, when waitresses entered in the kitchen, they they used to say to them “usted es una chica caliente” heheheh. They couldn’t undestand and aswered “what? Then they laughed and desconversavam. Good times! When alcoholic drinks were wasted in the tables I used to bring over to the people in the kitchen, and they love it!</p>

<p>The job of a busser is quite hard, most of the times just one meal wasn’t enough and in the end of our shift we were hungry again. Some employees always order an extra snack to the kitchen, but without the boss know it.  Once, a friend of my kept a hamburguer inside his trousers to eat it later, of course, the food was inside a plastic bag, but the funny thing was the moment he took the hamburguer from his trousers and said to me “do you want share with me?”.  I politely lied to him and said I was not hungry. I didn’t want eat a hamburger tasting like sausage.</p>

<p>My job in the restaurant was very busy, every day I used to arrive home from work with my body aching. I used to spend my break behind the restaurant, and it was common see other employees smoking and eating there as well. Most of the times I wasn’t alone, there were some mice looking at the rubbish.</p>

<p>The biggest problem of working there was my shift hours, I used to start at 5 pm and finish at 1 am, arriving at home around 2 am. And my wife used to work during the day, and it was becoming harder to see her.</p>

<p>Was the job that bad? Well, it wasn’t one of the best ones, bet definetely better than being a programmer =). I had the opportunity to know amazing people, change experiences, make new friends, improve myself as a person in general. I would do everything again, of course, apart from the mistakes.</p>

<p>I hope you like the text i have written, and if you are thinking to come to study and work in a restaurant, know thar ir’s a great experience, just try being less clumsy.</p>
